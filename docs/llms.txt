This is the R package `PowerAfterChange` for calculating power and
sample size for a Before-After t-test with fixed sites, repeated samples
per site. Possible questions to ask are:

1.  Given a fixed number of sites, samples per site before, and an
    assumed effect size and variances, (a) how many samples per site
    after are needed to achieve target power? or (b) what is the power
    for a given number of samples per site after?

2.  Given a fixed number of samples per site before and after, and an
    assumed effect size and variances, (a) how many sites are needed to
    achieve target power? and (b) what is the power for a given number
    of sites?

To load the project, run:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ebabcock/PowerAfterChange")
library(PowerAfterChange)
```

example.
